I have to go to sleep.
Today is June 18th and it is Muiriel's birthday!
I will be back soon.
I'm at a loss for words.
This is never going to end.
I just don't know what to say.

Then there is a problem...

Sometimes I can't help showing emotions.
It's a word I'd like to find a substitute for.
It would be something I'd have to program.
I don't intend to be selfish.
Let's consider the worst that could happen.
How many close friends do you have?
This is always the way it has been.
I think it is best not to be impolite.
One can always find time.
I'd be unhappy, but I wouldn't kill myself.
When I woke up, I was sad.
That is somewhat explained at the end.
I thought you liked to learn new things.

I can't tell her now. It's not that simple anymore.
Whenever I find something I like, it's too expensive.
How long did you stay?
Maybe it will be exactly the same for him.
Innocence is a beautiful thing.
Humans were never meant to live forever.
I think I have a theory about that.

There are many words that I don't understand.
I need to ask you a silly question.
I don't know how to demonstrate it, since it's too obvious!
Can it be phrased in another way?
It seems interesting to me.
Except that here, it's not so simple.
No, he's not my new boyfriend.

I don't want to wait that long.
Why don't you come visit us?
But the possibility seems unlikely.
I shouldn't have logged off.
I don't know what to do anymore.
I didn't want this to happen.
